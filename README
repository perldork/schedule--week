Schedule-Week version 0.01
============================

Schedule::Week represents an hourly week-long schedule (Sunday -> Saturday)
as an array of arrays, where the top-level array is days of the week, and
each day of the week holds a reference to an array of hours for the week.

Schedule::Week includes a number of ways to set and retrieve information 
from the schedule representation and also has the following functionality:
* Serialize and deserialize schedules into a format that is easy to
  store and retrieve with any language (168 char array of 1s and 0s)
* Check to see if any Unix epoch time would be active in the schedule
  with is_active($timestamp)
* Easily add hour ranges across all days with hours() function, e.g.
 
  #  Turn on 9 to 5 7 days a week
  $schedule->hours([9 ... 17])
* Loads of regression tests
